**Background Readings:**

Our implementation of the BOSS is grounded in the framework of Bayesian hierarchical models, specifically the conditional Latent Gaussian Models (cLGMs). 

Approximate Bayesian inference for LGMs typically relies on the Laplace approximation and Adaptive Gauss-Hermite Quadrature (AGHQ). For readers less familiar with these concepts, we recommend the following resources:

+ [Extended LGMs and their posterior approximation algorithm](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2022.2099403?casa_token=ft2At-UOBTIAAAAA%3Ab1e5AGFyefDSdwFHE2r9Q7Mcpv-npuWnGIH1LwyGzYdhs9DjHwcq32JBbILmz_ukn7pgWtVa7lAytg)

+ [LGMs and the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/71/2/319/7092907?login=false)

+ [AGHQ and its application in fitting LGMs
](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2022.2141635)


For readers seeking a deeper understanding of Gaussian processes and the Bayesian optimization algorithm, which are central to the BOSS framework, we recommend the following books:
